# Traffic Accident Analysis and Trends System

## Overview
Traffic accidents are a critical public safety concern, and understanding their patterns can help reduce risks and improve road safety. This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify trends, high-risk locations, and contributing factors, providing actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and safety advocates.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers in the dataset.
- **Accident Trend Analysis**: Identifies yearly, monthly, and daily accident trends.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Pinpoints high-risk areas using geographic data.
- **Contributing Factors**: Analyzes the impact of weather, time of day, and road conditions on accident frequency.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and heatmaps for easy understanding of trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Basic forecasting of accident rates using machine learning (optional).

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `NumPy`: For numerical computations.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `Plotly`: For interactive visualizations.
  - `Scikit-learn`: For predictive modeling (optional).
- **Data Source**: Publicly available traffic accident datasets (e.g., government or open data portals).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Traffic-Accident-Analysis.git
   cd Traffic-Accident-Analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your traffic accident dataset (CSV format) in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. View the generated visualizations and reports in the `outputs/` folder.
